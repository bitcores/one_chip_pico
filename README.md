A Famicom cartridge running on a Raspberry Pi Pico

This is the program driving the custom cartridge seen in https://forums.nesdev.org/viewtopic.php?p=287730&sid=39f16afe21ae319c02cf7025c29bdbed#p287730

It is heavily derived from the PicoCart64 project.

nes2h.py is used to convert your PRG .nes file to the prg_data.h file used to compile the PRG data into the program. This could be improved.
